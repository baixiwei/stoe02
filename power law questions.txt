Which of these graphs has the higher learning rate?

Which of these graphs has a higher initial time?

Suppose two students have the same learning rate, one has initial time 5, and the other has initial time 3. Which statement is true?

* The difference between the two students' times will be 2 seconds for all numbers of repetitions
* The ratio between the two students' times will be 5:3 ...
* 

The problem is that they can match just because I used the word ratio.

Suppose student A 


Practice

The 'steepness' of the graph indicates how fast reaction time is decreasing per repetition. 

Find a learning rate which takes longer to cut reaction time in half ...

Fix the initial time or learning rate, find which one makes it decrease fastest ...

Test

Learning rate determines the % or ratio decrease per repetition. Thus, the decrease is larger for larger initial time, and also larger for larger learning rate, but the time required to decrease by a certain percent depends only on learning rate. 

If two graphs have same initial learning time but different learning rates, the difference between their RTs will vary over time. If two graphs have ... 

How does the initial time affect how much reaction time decreases per repetition?
* The higher the initial time, the more the reaction time decreases per repetition
- The lower the initial time, the more the reaction time decreases per repetition
- The initial time does not affect how much reaction time decreases per repetition
- More than one of the above answers could be correct, depending on the learning rate.

How does the initial time affect the number of repetitions required to cut the reaction time in half?
- The higher the initial time, the larger the number of repetitions required
- The higher the initial time, the smaller the number of repetitions required
* The initial time does not affect how how many repetitions are required
- More than one of the above answers could be correct, depending on the learning rate.

How does the learning rate affect how much reaction time decreases per repetition?
* The higher the learning rate, the more the reaction time decreases time per repetition
- The lower the learning rate, the more the reaction time decreases per repetition
- The learning rate does not affect how much reaction time decreases per repetition
- More than one of the above answers could be correct, depending on the initial time.

How does the learning rate affect the number of repetitions required to cut the reaction time in half?
- The higher the learning rate, the larger the number of repetitions required
* The higher the learning rate, the smaller the number of repetitions required
- The learning rate does not affect how how many repetitions are required
- More than one of the above answers could be correct, depending on the initial time.

For which of these student will the reaction time on repetition 4 be 25% of the reaction time on repetition 1?
- Initial time = 4 seconds, learning rate = 1.6
- Initial time = 2.5 seconds, learning rate = 1.6
- Initial time = 2.5 seconds, learning rate = 0.4
* Initial time = 2.5 seconds, learning rate = 1.0

Suppose persons A and B have the same initial time, but person A's learning rate is 0.6, while person B's learning rate is 1.0. Then ...
- After the first repetition, Person A's reaction time will be 0.8 seconds faster than person A's
- After the first repetition, Person A's reaction time will be 0.8 seconds slower than person A's
- After the first repetition, Person A's reaction time will be 60% of person A's
* None of the above statements are true

Suppose persons A and B have the same learning rate, but person A's initial time is 2, while person B's initial time is 4. Then ...
- Person B's reaction time will be 2 seconds more than person A's, for any number of repetitions
* Person B's reaction time will be twice person A's, for any number of repetitions
- Both of the above statements are true
- None of the above statements are true

Suppose person A has initial time 2 and learning rate 0.6, while person B has initial time 4 and learning rate 1.0. Then ...
- Person A will always be faster than person B, for any number of repetitions
- Person B will always be faster than person A, for any number of repetitions
* Which of person A or person B is faster depends on the number of repetitions
- None of the above statements are true



Suppose person A has a slower initial time but a faster learning rate than person B. Which statement is true?
- Person A will always be faster regardless of the number of repetitions
- Person B will always be faster regardless of the number of repetitions
- Person A will be slower at first, but will eventually become faster ... REALLY? STUPID!

Suppose person A has a slower initial time but a faster learning rate than person B. After several repetitions ...
- Person A will be faster
- Person B will be faster
- Person A will be faster if the number of repetitions is large enough, but slower otherwise
- Person B will be faster if the number of repetitions is large enough, but slower otherwise





The difference in reaction time between two graphs with the same learning rate but different initial times ...
* ... decreases with the number of repetitions
- ... increases with the number of repetitions
- ... stays the same with the number of repetitions
- More than one of the above answers could be correct, depending on the learning rate of the two graphs
NOT GOOD

Which of these two graphs has a higher learning rate?

If two graphs have different learning rates, they ...
can't say CROSS, that only applies to superimposed.

Suppose student (or graph?) A has a faster initial time than student (or graph) B, but student B has a higher learning rate. After 2 repetitions, ...
- ... student A will be faster
- ... student B will be faster
- ... which student is faster depends on the difference in learning rates, but not on the initial times
* ... which student is faster depends on both the learning rates and the initial times

Suppose there are two students A and B. When will it be true that A starts faster but ends slower than B?
- This will always happen ...
- Sometimes happen ...
But they can't judge this based on what I've shown them.
